# What is notifi?

Notifi is an **open source error collecting software** that lets you view all the errors collected from your registered **React** flavored web applications. When a production bug comes up, you can head over to your Notifi dashboard to see the error stack. Speeds up your debugging process :)

## Key features

Some of the key features that Notifi provides are

- Complete error stack collection
- Listens to all the unhandled errors and exceptions thrown in your application
- Get an overview about the project status
- ~~Get daily reports~~ **(Work in progress and to be available in the pro tier üõ†Ô∏è)**
- ~~Take screenshots of the app when the error was caught~~ **(Work in progress and to be available in the pro tier üõ†Ô∏è)**

## Doesn't tools like **Sentry**, **hotjar** exist already?

Yes, I feel super insecure when offloading these analytics information to these 3rd party services. Instead, I wanted to create a platform that everyone can host for themselves & plug in to their application. Doing so would remove the dependency on these 3rd party services and keeps your data secure and in-house.
